## About

Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. The objective of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

This implementation of Reversi includes an AI opponent that uses the MinMax Algorithm to determine the best possible move, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience.

## Features

- **MinMax Algorithm**: The AI opponent evaluates possible moves and selects the optimal one based on the MinMax Algorithm.
- **Interactive UI**: The game provides a user-friendly interface for an engaging gameplay experience.
- **Two Player Mode**: Players can choose to play against the AI or against another human player.
